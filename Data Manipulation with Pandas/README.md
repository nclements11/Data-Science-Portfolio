In this section, I am learning to use **Pandas**, a powerful library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. The section covers fundamental concepts and techniques to effectively work with data, including:

- **Introduction to Data Manipulation with Pandas**: Learning how to load, clean, and manipulate data using Pandas DataFrames.
- **Lambda Functions for Pandas**: Applying custom functions efficiently to DataFrames using Pythonâ€™s `lambda` function.
- **Aggregates in Pandas**: Performing aggregation operations, like summing, averaging, and counting, on data to summarize key insights.
- **Multiple Tables in Pandas**: Working with multiple tables by merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames to analyze more complex datasets.

## Key Skills Learned

- **Data Manipulation**: Using Pandas for loading, cleaning, and modifying datasets.
- **Lambda Functions**: Applying custom operations using `lambda` to streamline data processing.
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing data with group-based operations and aggregate functions (e.g., `sum()`, `mean()`).
- **Merging and Joining**: Combining data from multiple sources using `merge()`, `concat()`, and `join()` to work with complex datasets.
