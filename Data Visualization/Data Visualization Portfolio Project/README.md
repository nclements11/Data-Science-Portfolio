For this project, I analyzed data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.



# Project Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

- Country: The name of the country for which the data is recorded.
- Year: The year in which the data was recorded.
- Life expectancy at birth (years): The average number of years a person born in a given year can expect to live
- GDP: The total GDP for each country and year. The numbers are often displayed in scientific notation, where "E+11" means the number is followed by 11 zeros (e.g., in the case of China, GDP in 2000 was approximately 1.211 trillion USD). 

# Objective

This project aims to answer questions such as:

Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations? Has GDP increased over time in the six nations? Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of country? What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
