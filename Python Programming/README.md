In these sections, I am learning the core concepts of Python programming and how they apply to data science. Topics covered include:

**Python Fundamentals for Data Science 1**:
  - **Data Types**: Understanding and using basic data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
  - **Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries**: Working with Python’s built-in data structures to organize and manage data.
  - **Control Flow**: Writing `if` statements, `for` and `while` loops to control the flow of code.
  - **Functions**: Defining and calling functions to create reusable and modular code.

**Python Fundamentals for Data Science 2**:
  - **Python Strings**: Learning string manipulation techniques to clean and transform text data. This includes methods for formatting, splitting, joining, and replacing text.
  - **Dictionaries**: Working with Python’s built-in dictionary data type, including operations like accessing, adding, and modifying key-value pairs.
  - **Reading and Writing Files**: Handling external data by reading from and writing to different file formats, including text files, CSVs, and JSON files. This is an essential skill for real-world data science tasks where data is often stored in these formats.

## Key Skills Learned

- **Python Basics**: Mastering Python syntax, operators, and fundamental data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
- **Data Structures**: Deepening knowledge of Python’s built-in data structures and using them for data manipulation.
- **Control Flow**: Using conditional statements and loops to structure Python code and handle different logic paths.
- **String Manipulation**: Using Python’s built-in string methods to process and transform text data, which is crucial for cleaning and preparing data.
- **Dictionaries**: Efficiently using dictionaries to store and retrieve data by key, a vital tool for working with structured data.
- **File Operations**: Reading and writing data files (such as CSVs) for data analysis tasks.
