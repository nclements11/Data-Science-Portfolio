# Overview
<br />
<br />

This Tableau project analyzes wildlife strike data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), focusing on collisions between aircraft and wildlife. The analysis centers on the top 20 busiest airports in the United States, exploring the frequency and severity of these incidents. This [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicholas.clements3585/viz/AircraftandWildlifeCollisions_17455931158770/Dashboard1) highlights total damages at each airport, average damage per collision, and the species most frequently involved.
